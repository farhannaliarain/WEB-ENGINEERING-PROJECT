                    <h1>Is your fundraising getting enough complaints?</h1>
                    If your fundraising never generates complaints from donors, it's not working at full strength.

                    There's a strong correlation between complaints and success in fundraising. Because any time you
                    grab
                    someone's attention and put a clear and urgent action in front of them, you potentially cause
                    discomfort.

                    Complaints from donors usually have a different quality. It's not so much that your
                    message causes them pain, as there's something about your message that isn't working for them.

                    Complaints from donors are important. You should engage with them and tell them the
                    truth about why your fundraising is the way it is. This typically leads to a better relationship
                    with the complaining donor, who now has deeper connection and insight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just don't re-engineer your messaging to pre-emptively avoid those complaints.

                    Anyone can carefully craft their fundraising so it avoids complaints. That avoidance torpedoes
                    fundraising results.

                    Want your fundraising to be more effective? Remove fear of offending people from your list of
                    requirements.
                    <br>

                    It's that simple (assuming you also do a good job of making the case). Complaints will trickle in,
                    but revenue will pour in. Try it. It works.

                    Your donors don't give because of what you do.
                    They give because of what they can do.

                    What's the difference?

                    There's no difference.

                    What you do and what they can do are the same thing.

                    But they are framed differently.

                    Here's tired old "what we do" fundraising:

                    Donate today so we can do something important.
                    Here's effective "what the donor can do" fundraising:

                    Donate today to do something important.
                    The two approaches are so close ... yet so far.
